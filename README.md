# lego part tracker ui

This is the UI project that helps keep track of finding Lego pieces needed to create a set that you own.  Its much easier to get all the pieces needed for a set first, then assemble it and not looking through a large collection while trying to build it.  This leverages data from http://rebrickable.com - a great site for all things Lego.
